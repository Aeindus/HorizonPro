INSTRUCTIONS when creating new components:
    - Add a reference to Core project
	- Change COMPONENT_TYPE to the component's type code
	- Add definition_debug.def:
EXPORTS
coInitComponent
getVersion
getType
debug

	 - Add defintion_release.def:
EXPORTS
coInitComponent
getVersion
getType

	 - Go to Properties-> Configuration Properties -> General -> Whole Program Optimisation -> No Whole Program Optimisation
	 - Two ways:
		a) Go to property pages and add the corresponding files to the component project (each file for 32,64 and release,debug = 4 pages)
		b) -> modify Linker->Advanced  (Debug+Release):
				x64:
					BASE ADDRESS 0x180000000
					RANDOMIZED BASE ADDRESS : NO
					FIXED BASE ADDRESS: NO

				x32:
					BASE ADDRESS 0x10000000
					RANDOMIZED BASE ADDRESS : NO
					FIXED BASE ADDRESS: NO
		  -> add Linker->Input (x32+x64):
				Debug:
					MODULE DEFINITION: definition_debug.def

				Release:
					MODULE DEFINITION: definition_release.def

	 - Add the code after #pragma code_seg(".crypt") starting with
	  the function main() and netloop()

	 - Add a reference to the Core project. Make sure you have selected in the linker "Link additional dependencies"
		You're good to go!
